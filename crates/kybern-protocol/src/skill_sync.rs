//! Your skills on every machine (ADE-86, the skills part of shared state).
//!
//! A *skill* is a folder with a `SKILL.md`. Each harness reads skills from its own user folders, called
//! *homes* here ([`SkillHome`]): `~/.agents/skills` (the cross-agent folder Codex, Cursor, OpenCode and
//! omp read), `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills`, `~/.config/opencode/skills`,
//! `~/.pi/agent/skills` and `~/.omp/agent/skills`. Project skills travel with their repository and are
//! not listed.
//!
//! * **Reading.** `skills.inventory` lists this machine's user skills with a content hash of each copy;
//!   `skills.network_view` asks every online member for its inventory (`peer.skills.inventory`) and lays
//!   the answers out per skill, so a client sees which machines have it and whether the copies match.
//! * **Copying** is explicit only. `skills.copy` sends one skill from a source machine (any member) to the
//!   machines the user chose. A target that has a different version keeps it unless its hash is in the
//!   target's `replaces` (the versions the user saw and agreed to replace); the replaced folder is moved
//!   to `<data dir>/skills-replaced/` there, never deleted. Daemons never copy skills on their own.
//! * **Transfer.** The source queues a `skill_copy` outbox item per other machine, so an offline target
//!   gets the skill when it returns. Delivery reuses the file send (`peer.files.*`, gated by
//!   `machine:files`) with a [`crate::PushDest::Skill`] destination. A copy is capped at
//!   [`MAX_SKILL_COPY_BYTES`]; symbolic links, `.git`, `node_modules` and files that look like secrets are
//!   left out and listed.
