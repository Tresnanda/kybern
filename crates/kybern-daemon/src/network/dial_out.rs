//! Members that are not on the tailnet (design §2.4c, §3.5).
//!
//! A machine added by code from outside the tailnet has no tailnet address, so no member can dial it.
//! It dials out instead. Every member that can be reached from the internet says where in the
//! `machine.<id>.url` register (its explicit `--advertise-url`, an `https` address); a machine that
//! cannot see another member on its tailnet opens its session to that URL. The session is the same
//! one a tailnet pair has (signed request, grant, one socket used both ways); the member that was
//! dialed sees an accepted link and relays clients to the machine through it (§3.4).
//!
//! Only members that publish a URL can be dialed. Other members still learn everything the dialed
//! one hears (operations are re-gossiped to every link), and a client reaches the machine through
//! the member holding its link, but a pair where neither side can be dialed has no daemon session.
//! Reaching such a machine from a third member by relaying its session is not implemented.
