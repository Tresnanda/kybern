# Changelog

## 0.1.7

- Reduce running-indicator repaint work and pause looping indicators when they are hidden or offscreen.
- Fix full-app translucency being hidden by an opaque content wrapper, and avoid stacking an extra tint in split panes.
- Redesign the context-usage popover with clearer token counts, usage meters, separate account limits, and keyboard access.
- Keep native ResizeObserver layout diagnostics out of fatal error banners and defer resize work to the next frame.
- Replace raw interface-error banners with a compact notice with expandable technical details, copy, and dismiss actions.
- Rebuild the mobile client around native tabs and Liquid Glass surfaces, with updated connection, thread, approval, and settings screens.

## 0.1.6

- Start drafting immediately while harness discovery refreshes, with cached harness choices on subsequent launches.
- Show context usage in the composer, with token details, supported account usage windows, and reset times on hover or focus.
- Add native manual compaction and discovered slash commands where supported by each harness.
- Add full-app translucency in Appearance, including floating surfaces and the terminal, with accessibility fallbacks.
- Fix composer wrapping, caret scrolling, and spacing alignment.
- Close owned harness processes reliably during session release and failed startup; preserve conversation history and provide safe reconnect guidance for Codex writer conflicts.
- Prevent Codex from appearing as its own subagent after resume, and exclude old false entries from activity views.
- Render Codex asynchronous questions as answerable forms. Keep unanswered forms across reloads and deliver submitted answers while the agent works.

Account limits and commands depend on the installed harness protocol. Kybern does not infer missing quotas or expose unsupported terminal-only commands.
